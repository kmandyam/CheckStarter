# CheckStarter
CheckStarter is a web application that attempts to solve the problem of complex medical procedures (and other procedures) using convenient checklists. Doctors are plagued by complicated procedures and stressful lifestyles, leading to small mistakes that could potentially lead to dangerous situations for patients. Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital, illustrates this problem in his book The Checklist Manifesto. The solution he prescribes is to follow a simple checklist. The results are remarkable; hospitals report great success with them. This is my attempt to provide an easy method of constructing, storing, and querying these checklists.
